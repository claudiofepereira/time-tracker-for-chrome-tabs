# Time tracker for chrome tabs
A script which tracks time spent in each chrome tab opened.

# TODO
- Find a better way to stop the program without using the ctrl+c exception
- Extract dictionary information to a json file
- Find a way to check if chrome is opened
- Create GUI in browser to access json information
    - Using flask and chart.js, create a dashboard for the urls and time information.

# Problems
- Sometimes a bug happens when exiting all chromes or starting the program without chrome opened
