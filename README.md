# Time tracker for chrome tabs
A script which tracks time spent in each chrome tab opened.

# TODO
- Create GUI in browser to access json information
    - Using flask and chart.js, create a dashboard for the urls and time information.
- See if code can be optimized and refactored
- Add a field for how many times the tab was opened [In the future]
- Find a better way to stop the program without using the ctrl+c exception [After GUI is made]

# Bugs
- Script crashes when closing all windows of chrome.
